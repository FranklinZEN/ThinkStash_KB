**Document: Testing Strategy \- Knowledge Card System**

Version: 0.1  
Date: 2025-04-21  
Status: Draft  
**1\. Introduction & Goals**

* **1.1 Overview:** This document defines the strategy, scope, methods, tools, and responsibilities for testing the Web-Based Knowledge Card System throughout its development lifecycle.  
* **1.2 Goals:**  
  * Ensure the application meets functional requirements defined in the PRD and JIRA tickets.  
  * Verify non-functional requirements (Performance, Reliability \- see NFR Document).  
  * Identify and fix defects early in the development cycle.  
  * Ensure high code quality and maintainability through automated tests.  
  * Validate security requirements (see Security Document).  
  * Confirm a positive user experience (Usability, Accessibility).  
  * Build confidence in releases.  
* **1.3 Scope:** This strategy applies to both Stage 1 (Prototype) and Stage 2 (Production/Cloud) development, with increasing emphasis on certain testing types (e.g., performance, E2E) in Stage 2\. It covers frontend, backend API, database interactions, and integrations.

**2\. Testing Levels & Scope**

* **2.1 Unit Testing:**  
  * **Focus:** Verify individual functions, components, or modules in isolation. Ensure smallest units of code work correctly.  
  * **Scope:**  
    * Backend: Utility functions, service layer logic (e.g., data transformation, validation logic), individual API route handlers (mocking dependencies).  
    * Frontend: Individual React components (rendering, props, basic state changes), utility functions, state management logic (Zustand store actions/selectors).  
  * **Tools:** **Jest** (or potentially **Vitest** as a faster alternative) as the test runner/framework, **React Testing Library** for testing React components without relying on implementation details.  
  * **Responsibility:** Developers writing the code.  
* **2.2 Integration Testing:**  
  * **Focus:** Verify interactions between different components or modules. Ensure units work together as expected.  
  * **Scope:**  
    * Backend: API endpoint testing (making actual HTTP requests to API routes and verifying responses, potentially interacting with a test database), testing interactions between service layers and the database (using a dedicated test database instance).  
    * Frontend: Testing components that interact with each other (e.g., form submission triggering state updates and API calls), testing interactions with state management, testing components that fetch data via mocked API calls.  
  * **Tools:** **Jest/Vitest**, **React Testing Library**, **Supertest** (for backend API endpoint testing), potentially **MSW (Mock Service Worker)** for mocking API requests from the frontend. A dedicated test database (e.g., separate PostgreSQL container/schema seeded with test data).  
  * **Responsibility:** Developers.  
* **2.3 End-to-End (E2E) Testing:**  
  * **Focus:** Verify complete user flows through the application from the user's perspective, simulating real user interactions in a browser.  
  * **Scope:** Critical user journeys defined in the PRD, such as:  
    * User registration and login.  
    * Creating a knowledge card (direct content, file upload).  
    * Searching for cards.  
    * Creating and managing folders.  
    * Moving cards between folders.  
    * Editing user profile.  
  * **Tools:** **Playwright** (Recommended for its speed, reliability, and features) or **Cypress**. These tools automate browser interactions.  
  * **Environment:** Run against a deployed instance of the application in a dedicated test/staging environment closely mirroring production.  
  * **Responsibility:** Developers or dedicated QA engineers (if available). Primarily focused on Stage 2 readiness.

**3\. Testing Types**

* **3.1 Functional Testing:** Ensures features work according to requirements. Primarily covered by Unit, Integration, and E2E tests. Manual exploratory testing will also be performed.  
* **3.2 Performance Testing:**  
  * **Focus:** Verify application performance under expected load (response times, resource utilization). Aligns with NFRs.  
  * **Scope (Primarily Stage 2):** Key API endpoints, critical user flows under simulated load.  
  * **Tools:** **k6**, **JMeter**, or cloud provider tools (e.g., AWS load testing services).  
  * **Responsibility:** Developers/QA/DevOps.  
* **3.3 Security Testing:**  
  * **Focus:** Identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities.  
  * **Scope:** As outlined in the Security Document.  
  * **Methods:** Dependency scanning (npm audit, Dependabot/Snyk), static analysis security testing (SAST) tools (linters, specialized tools if adopted), dynamic analysis (DAST) via E2E tests checking for basic vulnerabilities, manual security reviews, and formal Penetration Testing (Recommended for Stage 2).  
  * **Responsibility:** All developers, potentially specialized security testers/external consultants (for pentesting).  
* **3.4 Accessibility Testing (A11y):**  
  * **Focus:** Ensure the application is usable by people with disabilities.  
  * **Scope:** Adherence to WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines.  
  * **Methods:**  
    * Use **Chakra UI**'s built-in accessibility features.  
    * Automated checks using tools like **Axe** (e.g., @axe-core/react, browser extensions).  
    * Manual testing (keyboard navigation, screen reader testing \- e.g., NVDA, VoiceOver).  
  * **Responsibility:** Developers (component level), QA/Design (manual checks).  
* **3.5 Usability Testing:**  
  * **Focus:** Evaluate how easy and intuitive the application is to use.  
  * **Methods:** Manual exploratory testing, heuristic evaluation, potentially informal user feedback sessions on prototypes or early versions.  
  * **Responsibility:** PM, Design, QA, Developers.

**4\. Test Environments**

* **Local Development:** Developers run unit and integration tests locally during development.  
* **CI Environment:** Automated tests (unit, integration, potentially basic E2E checks, linting, security scans) run on every code commit/pull request via GitHub Actions.  
* **Staging Environment (Stage 2):** A deployed environment closely mirroring production. Used for E2E testing, performance testing, security testing, and UAT (User Acceptance Testing).  
* **Production Environment (Stage 2):** Live environment. Monitoring and alerting are key here, rather than extensive pre-release testing.

**5\. Test Data Management**

* **Unit Tests:** Use mocked data or small, focused data sets defined within the test.  
* **Integration Tests:** Use a dedicated test database seeded with predefined, consistent test data. Scripts should be created to manage seeding and cleanup. Avoid relying on data from previous test runs.  
* **E2E Tests:** Requires a stable set of test accounts and data in the staging environment. Strategies for resetting data between test runs might be needed.

**6\. Tools & Frameworks Summary**

* **Test Runner/Framework:** Jest or Vitest  
* **React Component Testing:** React Testing Library  
* **Backend API Testing:** Supertest (or native fetch within Jest/Vitest)  
* **E2E Testing:** Playwright (Recommended) or Cypress  
* **API Mocking (Frontend):** MSW (Mock Service Worker)  
* **Performance Testing:** k6 or JMeter  
* **Accessibility Testing:** Axe (@axe-core/react), manual checks  
* **Dependency Scanning:** npm audit, Dependabot/Snyk  
* **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions

**7\. Code Coverage**

* **Goal:** Aim for a meaningful level of code coverage (e.g., 70-80% for critical backend logic and frontend components) as measured by unit and integration tests. Coverage is a guide, not a strict rule; focus on testing critical paths and logic effectively.  
* **Tools:** Jest/Vitest built-in coverage reporting. Tools like Codecov or Coveralls can be integrated with CI for tracking coverage over time.

**8\. Defect Management**

* Bugs found during testing (manual or automated) will be reported as JIRA tickets.  
* Tickets should include: Steps to reproduce, expected result, actual result, severity, environment, screenshots/logs where applicable.  
* Bugs will be prioritized by the PM and assigned for fixing.  
* Fixed bugs should ideally have a regression test added to prevent recurrence.

**9\. Roles & Responsibilities**

* **Developers:** Write unit and integration tests for their code. Fix bugs found in their code. Participate in E2E test development and maintenance. Perform basic accessibility checks.  
* **QA (If applicable):** Develop/maintain E2E tests. Perform manual exploratory testing, usability testing, accessibility testing. Manage test environments and data. Oversee defect tracking.  
* **Product Manager (PM):** Define acceptance criteria. Prioritize bugs. Coordinate UAT.  
* **Design:** Provide input on usability and accessibility testing.

**Questions for PM/Stakeholders:**

1. **Code Coverage Target:** Is the suggested 70-80% target acceptable, understanding it's a guideline?  
2. **Dedicated QA Resources:** Will there be dedicated QA resources, or will testing rely primarily on developers and PM/Design for manual checks? (This impacts the feasibility of extensive manual and E2E testing).  
3. **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):** Who will be responsible for final UAT before major releases (Stage 2)?

**TL Recommendations & Alternatives:**

1. **Tooling:** Strongly recommend **Playwright** for E2E testing due to its modern architecture and capabilities. Recommend **Jest** (stable, widely used) or **Vitest** (faster alternative gaining traction) for unit/integration tests.  
2. **Automation Focus:** Prioritize robust unit and integration tests, as they provide the best ROI for catching bugs early. E2E tests are valuable but can be more brittle and slower; focus them on the most critical "happy path" user flows.  
3. **CI Integration:** Integrate automated tests (unit, integration, linting, security scans) into the CI pipeline (GitHub Actions) from the beginning to provide fast feedback.

**Draft Rating:**

* **Completion:** 80% (Covers standard testing levels, types, and processes. Needs confirmation on QA resources, coverage targets, and UAT process).  
* **Quality/Accuracy:** High (Aligns with modern web application testing best practices and the project's tech stack).  
* **Collaboration Needed:** Review the proposed strategy, answer PM questions, confirm tooling choices, refine scope based on resource availability.
